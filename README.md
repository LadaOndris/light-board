# Light board

Light board is an embedded application intended for demonstration of programming a microcontroller.
Specifically, it displays a running text on a matrix board, allows changing preprogrammed texts via buttons, and supports entering custom texts via UART interface.
The project demonstrates:
* the configuration of an MCU, 
* setting up a PIT timer and acting when interrupts are received,
* communication via UART interface,
* using buttons connected via GPIO pins,
* and, finally, controlling a matrix display as a peripheral through GPIO pins.
